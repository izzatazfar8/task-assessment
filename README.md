# Task Assessment

This repository contains assessments involving Python analytics and Kafka data streaming setups. It is divided into two main parts:
1. **Python Analytics** - Scripts for analyzing datasets on bank and credit card complaints, and bank marketing.
2. **Kafka Assessment** - Scripts and configurations for setting up Apache Kafka to consume data from Kafka topics.

## Project Structure

### Python Analytics (`python_assessment`)
This folder contains scripts for analyzing datasets on bank and credit card complaints and bank marketing data. Each script loads a specific dataset and performs exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

- **Scripts**:
  - `Q4_1_bank_complaint_analytic.py` - Analyzes bank complaints data.
  - `Q4_2_credit_card_complaint_analytic.py` - Analyzes credit card complaints data.
  - `Question#5_bank_marketing_analytic.py` - Analyzes bank marketing data.
  
- **Datasets**:
  - **Bank and Credit Card Complaints**:
    - **Source**: [Bank and Credit Card Complaints on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/bank-and-credit-card-complaints)
  - **Bank Marketing Dataset**:
    - **Source**: [Bank Marketing Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-dataset)

### Kafka Assessment (`kafka_assessment`)
This folder contains scripts and configurations for working with Apache Kafka. It includes consumer scripts for consuming data from Kafka topics.
